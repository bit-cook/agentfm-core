// Entry is the materialised view of a SignedEntry once it has been
// written to (or read from) a ledger. Callers receive Entry values from
// fetch / iterate APIs added in P1-2.
//
//   - Hash is SHA-256(CanonicalSignedEntry(Payload)) — what the Merkle
//     tree uses as its leaf hash and what other entries reference as
//     prev_hash.
//   - Index is the zero-based position in the issuing peer's log.
//   - Payload is the verified envelope; never nil for a value returned
//     from a Ledger method.

	// it as the next entry in the log, updates the Merkle tree, signs a

	// the inserted entry. Best-effort gossip — local persistence success
	// is reported even if publishing fails.

	// pending its parent. knownHead, if non-nil, supplies the expected
	// LogHead state for stricter verification (used by inclusion-proof

// on-disk store at Open, so a process restart resumes the chain at
// the correct prev_hash without losing any entries.
