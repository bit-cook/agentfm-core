// This file isolates the container execution *policy* — the exact argv handed
// to `podman run` — from the side effects around it (session IDs, directory
// creation, GPU probing, process spawning). That split exists for one reason:
// BuildRunArgs is pure, so the policy can be asserted in a unit test.
//
// Before this split the argv was assembled inline inside executePodman, which
// spawns a process and therefore cannot be exercised without a container
// runtime. The practical consequence was that removing a security flag broke
// no test. Every hardening item that follows (S2/S3/S4, R1) lands here and
// ships with a test that fails when the flag is removed.
//
// The golden tests in sandbox_spec_test.go pin the CURRENT argv byte for byte.
// They are expected — and intended — to fail the moment hardening is added.
// That failure is the review signal: an argv change to the sandbox must never
// pass unnoticed.

// NetworkMode selects the network namespace the task container runs in.
//
// It is a closed enum validated by BuildRunArgs: an unrecognised value is an
// error, never a silent fallback. Today only NetworkHost is implemented, which
// mirrors the long-standing behaviour. NetworkNone and an egress allowlist
// arrive with roadmap item S4; the deny-by-default switch below is what makes
// adding them a compile-and-test event rather than a silent default change.
